To install and use in Windows:

- To install, put paq8pxd.exe or a shortcut to it on your desktop.
- To compress a file or folder, drop it on the paq8pxd icon.
- To decompress, drop a .paq8pxd file on the icon.

A .paq8pxd extension is added for compression, removed for decompression.
The output will go in the same folder as the input.

While paq8pxd is working, a command window will appear and report
progress.  When it is done you can close the window by pressing
ENTER or clicking [X].


COMMAND LINE INTERFACE

- To install, put paq8pxd.exe somewhere in your PATH.
- To compress:      paq8pxd [-N] file1 [file2...]
- To decompress:    paq8pxd [-d] file1.paq8pxd [dir2]
- To view contents: paq8pxd -l file1.paq8pxd

The compressed output file is named by adding ".paq8pxd" extension to
the first named file (file1.paq8pxd).  Each file that exists will be
added to the archive and its name will be stored without a path.
The option -N specifies a compression level ranging from -0
(fastest) to -8 (smallest).  The default is -5.  If there is
no option and only one file, then the program will pause when
finished until you press the ENTER key (to support drag and drop).
If file1.paq8pxd exists then it is overwritten. Level -0 only
transforms or decompresses data.

If the first named file ends in ".paq8pxd" then it is assumed to be
an archive and the files within are extracted to the same directory
as the archive unless a different directory (dir2) is specified.
The -d option forces extraction even if there is not a ".paq8pxd"
extension.  If any output file already exists, then it is compared
with the archive content and the first byte that differs is reported.
No files are overwritten or deleted.  If there is only one argument
(no -d or dir2) then the program will pause when finished until
you press ENTER.

For compression, if any named file is actually a directory, then all
files and subdirectories are compressed, preserving the directory
structure, except that empty directories are not stored, and file
attributes (timestamps, permissions, etc.) are not preserved.
During extraction, directories are created as needed.  For example:

  paq8pxd -4 c:\tmp\foo bar

compresses foo and bar (if they exist) to c:\tmp\foo.paq8pxd at level 4.

  paq8pxd -d c:\tmp\foo.paq8pxd .

extracts foo and compares bar in the current directory.  If foo and bar
are directories then their contents are extracted/compared.

There are no commands to update an existing archive or to extract
part of an archive.  Files and archives larger than 2GB are not
supported (but might work on 64-bit machines, not tested).
File names with nonprintable characters are not supported (spaces
are OK).


TO COMPILE

There are 2 files: paq8pxd.cpp (C++) and wrtpre.cpp (C++).
paq8pxd.cpp recognizes the following compiler options:

  -DWINDOWS           (to compile in Windows)
  -DUNIX              (to compile in Unix, Linux, etc)
  -DMT                (to compile with multithreading support)
  -DDEFAULT_OPTION=N  (to change the default compression level from 8 to N).

If you compile without -DWINDOWS or -DUNIX, you can still compress files,
but you cannot compress directories or create them during extraction.
You can extract directories if you manually create the empty directories
first.

Use -DEFAULT_OPTION=N to change the default compression level to support
drag and drop on machines with less than 256 MB of memory.  Use
-DDEFAULT_OPTION=4 for 128 MB, 3 for 64 MB, 2 for 32 MB, etc.


Recommended compiler commands and optimizations:

  MINGW g++ (x86,x64):
   with multithreading:
    g++ paq8pxd.cpp -DWINDOWS -DMT -msse2 -O3 -s -static -o paq8pxd.exe 
   without multithreading:
    g++ paq8pxd.cpp -DWINDOWS -msse2 -O3 -s -static -o paq8pxd.exe 

  UNIX/Linux (PC x86,x64):
   with multithreading:
    g++ paq8pxd.cpp -DUNIX -DMT -msse2 -O3 -s -static -lpthread -o paq8pxd
   without multithreading:
    g++ paq8pxd.cpp -DUNIX -msse2 -O3 -s -static -lpthread -o paq8pxd

  Non PC (e.g. PowerPC under MacOS X)
    g++ paq8pxd.cpp -O2 -DUNIX -s -o paq8pxd


ARCHIVE FILE FORMAT

An archive has the following format.  

  paq8pxd -N 
  segment offset 8 bytes
  segment size  2 bytes
  compressed segment size 2 bytes
  streams (0b00000xxx xxxxxxxx) 2 bytes
  \0 file list size
  compressed file list(
    size TAB filename CR LF
    size TAB filename CR LF
    ...)
  compressed binary data
  file segmentation data
  stream data sizes[11]

-N is the option (-0 to -15) and mode, even if a default was used.
00LMNNNN bit M is set if fast mode, 
         bit L is set if quick mode,
         if L or M are not set default to slow mode.

segment size is total size of file(s) 
compressed segment size is compressed segmentation data in bytes
at segmnet offset after compressed binary data.

file segmentation data is full list of detected blocks:
type size info
type size info
type size 
type size info
.....

info is present if block type needs extra info like in image or audio.

streams - if bit is set then stream is present. Right to left order
for stream 10 to 0. If bit is set store stream lengt to archive.

Plain file names are stored without a path.  Files in compressed
directories are stored with path relative to the compressed directory
(using UNIX style forward slashes "/").  For example, given these files:

  123 C:\dir1\file1.txt
  456 C:\dir2\file2.txt

Then

  paq8pxd archive \dir1\file1.txt \dir2

will create archive.paq8pxd 

The command:

  paq8pxd archive.paq8pxd C:\dir3

will create the files:

  C:\dir3\file1.txt
  C:\dir3\dir2\file2.txt

Decompression will fail if the first 10 bytes are not "paq8pxd -".  Sizes
are stored as decimal numbers.  CR, LF, TAB are ASCII codes
13, 10, 9 respectively.


ARITHMETIC CODING

The binary data is arithmetic coded as the shortest base 256 fixed point
number x = SUM_i x_i 256^-1-i such that p(<y) <= x < p(<=y), where y is the
input string, x_i is the i'th coded byte, p(<y) (and p(<=y)) means the
probability that a string is lexicographcally less than (less than
or equal to) y according to the model, _ denotes subscript, and ^ denotes
exponentiation.

The model p(y) for y is a conditional bit stream,
p(y) = PROD_j p(y_j | y_0..j-1) where y_0..j-1 denotes the first j
bits of y, and y_j is the next bit.  Compression depends almost entirely
on the ability to predict the next bit accurately.


MODEL MIXING

paq8pxd uses a neural network to combine a large number of models.  The
i'th model independently predicts
p1_i = p(y_j = 1 | y_0..j-1), p0_i = 1 - p1_i.
The network computes the next bit probabilty

  p1 = squash(SUM_i w_i t_i), p0 = 1 - p1                        (1)

where t_i = stretch(p1_i) is the i'th input, p1_i is the prediction of
the i'th model, p1 is the output prediction, stretch(p) = ln(p/(1-p)),
and squash(s) = 1/(1+exp(-s)).  Note that squash() and stretch() are
inverses of each other.

After bit y_j (0 or 1) is received, the network is trained:

  w_i := w_i + eta t_i (y_j - p1)                                (2)

where eta is an ad-hoc learning rate, t_i is the i'th input, (y_j - p1)
is the prediction error for the j'th input but, and w_i is the i'th
weight.  Note that this differs from back propagation:

  w_i := w_i + eta t_i (y_j - p1) p0 p1                          (3)

which is a gradient descent in weight space to minimize root mean square
error.  Rather, the goal in compression is to minimize coding cost,
which is -log(p0) if y = 1 or -log(p1) if y = 0.  Taking
the partial derivative of cost with respect to w_i yields (2).


MODELS

Most models are context models.  A function of the context (last few
bytes) is mapped by a lookup table or hash table to a state which depends
on the bit history (prior sequence of 0 and 1 bits seen in this context).
The bit history is then mapped to p1_i by a fixed or adaptive function.
There are several types of bit history states:

- Run Map. The state is (b,n) where b is the last bit seen (0 or 1) and
  n is the number of consecutive times this value was seen.  The initial
  state is (0,0).  The output is computed directly:

    t_i = (2b - 1)K log(n + 1).

  where K is ad-hoc, around 4 to 10.  When bit y_j is seen, the state
  is updated:

    (b,n) := (b,n+1) if y_j = b, else (y_j,1).

- Stationary Map.  The state is p, initially 1/2.  The output is
  t_i = stretch(p).  The state is updated at ad-hoc rate K (around 0.01):

    p := p + K(y_j - p)

- Nonstationary Map.  This is a compromise between a stationary map, which
  assumes uniform statistics, and a run map, which adapts quickly by
  discarding old statistics.  An 8 bit state represents (n0,n1,h), initially
  (0,0,0) where:

    n0 is the number of 0 bits seen "recently".
    n1 is the number of 1 bits seen "recently".
    n = n0 + n1.
    h is the full bit history for 0 <= n <= 4,
      the last bit seen (0 or 1) if 5 <= n <= 15,
      0 for n >= 16.

  The primaty output is t_i := stretch(sm(n0,n1,h)), where sm(.) is
  a stationary map with K = 1/256, initialized to
  sm(n0,n1,h) = (n1+(1/64))/(n+2/64).  Four additional inputs are also
  be computed to improve compression slightly:

    p1_i = sm(n0,n1,h)
    p0_i = 1 - p1_i
    t_i   := stretch(p_1)
    t_i+1 := K1 (p1_i - p0_i)
    t_i+2 := K2 stretch(p1) if n0 = 0, -K2 stretch(p1) if n1 = 0, else 0
    t_i+3 := K3 (-p0_i if n1 = 0, p1_i if n0 = 0, else 0)
    t_i+4 := K3 (-p0_i if n0 = 0, p1_i if n1 = 0, else 0)

  where K1..K4 are ad-hoc constants.

  h is updated as follows:
    If n < 4, append y_j to h.
    Else if n <= 16, set h := y_j.
    Else h = 0.

  The update rule is biased toward newer data in a way that allows
  n0 or n1, but not both, to grow large by discarding counts of the
  opposite bit.  Large counts are incremented probabilistically.
  Specifically, when y_j = 0 then the update rule is:

    n0 := n0 + 1, n < 29
          n0 + 1 with probability 2^(27-n0)/2 else n0, 29 <= n0 < 41
          n0, n = 41.
    n1 := n1, n1 <= 5
          round(8/3 lg n1), if n1 > 5

  swapping (n0,n1) when y_j = 1.

  Furthermore, to allow an 8 bit representation for (n0,n1,h), states
  exceeding the following values of n0 or n1 are replaced with the
  state with the closest ratio n0:n1 obtained by decrementing the
  smaller count: (41,0,h), (40,1,h), (12,2,h), (5,3,h), (4,4,h),
  (3,5,h), (2,12,h), (1,40,h), (0,41,h).  For example:
  (12,2,1) 0-> (7,1,0) because there is no state (13,2,0).

- Match Model.  The state is (c,b), initially (0,0), where c is 1 if
  the context was previously seen, else 0, and b is the next bit in
  this context.  The prediction is:

    t_i := (2b - 1)Kc log(m + 1)

  where m is the length of the context.  The update rule is c := 1,
  b := y_j.  A match model can be implemented efficiently by storing
  input in a buffer and storing pointers into the buffer into a hash
  table indexed by context.  Then c is indicated by a hash table entry
  and b can be retrieved from the buffer.


CONTEXTS

High compression is achieved by combining a large number of contexts.
Most (not all) contexts start on a byte boundary and end on the bit
immediately preceding the predicted bit.  The contexts below are
modeled with both a run map and a nonstationary map unless indicated.

- Order n.  The last n bytes, up to about 16.  For general purpose data.
  Most of the compression occurs here for orders up to about 6.
  An order 0 context includes only the 0-7 bits of the partially coded
  byte and the number of these bits (255 possible values).

- Sparse.  Usually 1 or 2 of the last 8 bytes preceding the byte containing
  the predicted bit, e.g (2), (3),..., (8), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6),
  (2,3), (2,4), (3,6), (4,8).  The ordinary order 1 and 2 context, (1)
  or (1,2) are included above.  Useful for binary data.

- Text.  Contexts consists of whole words (a-z, converted to lower case
  and skipping other values).  Contexts may be sparse, e.g (0,2) meaning
  the current (partially coded) word and the second word preceding the
  current one.  Useful contexts are (0), (0,1), (0,1,2), (0,2), (0,3),
  (0,4).  The preceding byte may or may not be included as context in the
  current word.

- Formatted text.  The column number (determined by the position of
  the last linefeed) is combined with other contexts: the charater to
  the left and the character above it.

- Fixed record length.  The record length is determined by searching for
  byte sequences with a uniform stride length.  Once this is found, then
  the record length is combined with the context of the bytes immediately
  preceding it and the corresponding byte locations in the previous
  one or two records (as with formatted text).

- Context gap.  The distance to the previous occurrence of the order 1
  or order 2 context is combined with other low order (1-2) contexts.

- FAX.  For 2-level bitmapped images.  Contexts are the surrounding
  pixels already seen.  Image width is assumed to be 1728 bits (as
  in calgary/pic).

- Image.  For uncompressed 8,24-bit color BMP, TIFF and TGA images.
  Contexts are the high order bits of the surrounding pixels and linear
  combinations of those pixels, including other color planes.  The
  image width is detected from the file header.  When an image is
  detected, other models are turned off to improve speed.

- JPEG.  Files are further compressed by partially uncompressing back
  to the DCT coefficients to provide context for the next Huffman code.
  Only baseline DCT-Huffman coded files are modeled.  (This ia about
  90% of images, the others are usually progresssive coded).  JPEG images
  embedded in other files (quite common) are detected by headers.  The
  baseline JPEG coding process is:
  - Convert to grayscale and 2 chroma colorspace.
  - Sometimes downsample the chroma images 2:1 or 4:1 in X and/or Y.
  - Divide each of the 3 images into 8x8 blocks.
  - Convert using 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT) to 64 12-bit signed
    coefficients.
  - Quantize the coefficients by integer division (lossy).
  - Split the image into horizontal slices coded independently, separated
    by restart codes.
  - Scan each block starting with the DC (0,0) coefficient in zigzag order
    to the (7,7) coefficient, interleaving the 3 color components in
    order to scan the whole image left to right starting at the top.
  - Subtract the previous DC component from the current in each color.
  - Code the coefficients using RS codes, where R is a run of R zeros (0-15)
    and S indicates 0-11 bits of a signed value to follow.  (There is a
    special RS code (EOB) to indicate the rest of the 64 coefficients are 0).
  - Huffman code the RS symbol, followed by S literal bits.
  The most useful contexts are the current partially coded Huffman code
  (including S following bits) combined with the coefficient position
  (0-63), color (0-2), and last few RS codes.

- Match.  When a context match of 400 bytes or longer is detected,
  the next bit of the match is predicted and other models are turned
  off to improve speed.

- Exe.  When a x86 file (.exe, .obj, .dll) is detected, sparse contexts
  with gaps of 1-12 selecting only the prefix, opcode, and the bits
  of the modR/M byte that are relevant to parsing are selected.
  This model is turned off otherwise.

- Indirect.  The history of the last 1-3 bytes in the context of the
  last 1-2 bytes is combined with this 1-2 byte context.

- DMC. A bitwise n-th order context is built from a state machine using
  DMC, described in http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~ftp/dmc/dmc.c
  The effect is to extend a single context, one bit at a time and predict
  the next bit based on the history in this context.  The model here differs
  in that two predictors are used.  One is a pair of counts as in the original
  DMC.  The second predictor is a bit history state mapped adaptively to
  a probability as as in a Nonstationary Map.

ARCHITECTURE

The context models are mixed by several of several hundred neural networks
selected by a low-order context.  The outputs of these networks are
combined using a second neural network, then fed through several stages of
adaptive probability maps (APM) before arithmetic coding.

For images, only one neural network is used and its context is fixed.

An APM is a stationary map combining a context and an input probability.
The input probability is stretched and divided into 32 segments to
combine with other contexts.  The output is interpolated between two
adjacent quantized values of stretch(p1).  There are 2 APM stages in series:

  p1 := (p1 + 3 APM(order 0, p1)) / 4.
  p1 := (APM(order 1, p1) + 2 APM(order 2, p1) + APM(order 3, p1)) / 4.

PREPROCESSING

paq8pxd uses preprocessing transforms on certain data types to improve
compression.  To improve reliability, the decoding transform is
tested during compression to ensure that the input file can be
restored.  If the decoder output is not identical to the input file
due to a bug, then the transform is abandoned and the data is compressed
without a transform so that it will still decompress correctly.

The input is split into blocks with the format <type> <decoded size> <info>
where <type> is 1 byte (0 = no transform), <decoded size> is the size
of the data after decoding, which may be different than the size of <data>.
Data is stored uncompressed after compressed data ends.
The preprocessor has 3 parts:

- Detector.  Splits the input into smaller blocks depending on data type.

- Coder.  Input is a block to be compressed.  Output is a temporary
  file.  The coder determines whether a transform is to be applied
  based on file type, and if so, which one.  A coder may use lots
  of resources (memory, time) and make multiple passes through the
  input file.  The file type is stored (as one byte) during compression.

- Decoder.  Performs the inverse transform of the coder.  It uses few
  resorces (fast, low memory) and runs in a single pass (stream oriented).
  It takes input either from a file or the arithmetic decoder.  Each call
  to the decoder returns a single decoded byte.

The following transforms are used:

- EXE:  CALL (0xE8) and JMP (0xE9) address operands are converted from
  relative to absolute address.  The transform is to replace the sequence
  E8/E9 xx xx xx 00/FF by adding file offset modulo 2^25 (signed range,
  little-endian format).  Data to transform is identified by trying the
  transform and applying a crude compression test: testing whether the
  byte following the E8/E8 (LSB of the address) occurred more recently
  in the transformed data than the original and within 4KB 4 times in
  a row.  The block ends when this does not happen for 4KB.

- DEC Alpha: Swap byte order, do call transform

- ARM: do call transform

- JPEG: detected by SOI and SOF and ending with EOI or any nondecodable
  data.  No transform is applied.  The purpose is to separate images
  embedded in execuables to block the EXE transform, and for a future
  place to insert a transform.
  
- BASE64: Decodes BASE64 encoded data and recursively transformed
  up to level 5. Input can be full stream or end-of-line coded.
  
- BASE85: Decodes Ascii85 encoded data and recursively transformed
  up to level 5. Input can be full stream or end-of-line coded.
  Supports: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85#Adobe_version

- UUENCODE: Decodes UUENCODE encoded data.

- 24-bit images: 24-bit image data uses simple color transform
  (b, g, r) -> (g, g-r, g-b)
  
- ZLIB:  Decodes zlib encoded data and recursively transformed
  up to level 5. Supports zlib compressed images (4/8/24 bit) in pdf

- GIF:  Gif (8 bit) image  recompression. 
  
- CD: mode 1 and mode 2 form 1+2 - 2352 bytes

- MDF: wraped around CD, re-arranges subchannel and CD data

- TEXT: All detected text blocks are transformed using dynamic dictionary
  preprocessing (based on XWRT). If transformed block is larger from original
  then transform is skipped.
  
- LZSS: (Haruhiko Okumura's LZSS): Decompresses Microsoft compress.exe archives.

- MRB: 8, 4 bit images with RLE compression in hlp files

- RLE: TGA, TIFF images

- EOL: 


IMPLEMENTATION

Hash tables are designed to minimize cache misses, which consume most
of the CPU time.

Most of the memory is used by the nonstationary context models.
Contexts are represented by 32 bits, possibly a hash.  These are
mapped to a bit history, represented by 1 byte.  The hash table is
organized into 64-byte buckets on cache line boundaries.  Each bucket
contains 7 x 7 bit histories, 7 16-bit checksums, and a 2 element LRU
queue packed into one byte.  Each 7 byte element represents 7 histories
for a context ending on a 3-bit boundary plus 0-2 more bits.  One
element (for bits 0-1, which have 4 unused bytes) also contains a run model
consisting of the last byte seen and a count (as 1 byte each).

Run models use 4 byte hash elements consisting of a 2 byte checksum, a
repeat count (0-255) and the byte value.  The count also serves as
a priority.

Stationary models are most appropriate for small contexts, so the
context is used as a direct table lookup without hashing.

The match model maintains a pointer to the last match until a mismatching
bit is found.  At the start of the next byte, the hash table is referenced
to find another match.  The hash table of pointers is updated after each
whole byte.  There is no checksum.  Collisions are detected by comparing
the current and matched context in a rotating buffer.

The inner loops of the neural network prediction (1) and training (2)
algorithms are implemented in MMX assembler, which computes 4 elements
at a time.  Using assembler is 8 times faster than C++ for this code
and 1/3 faster overall.  (However I found that SSE2 code on an AMD-64,
which computes 8 elements at a time, is not any faster).

/////////////////////////// ContextMap /////////////////////////
//
// A ContextMap maps contexts to a bit histories and makes predictions
// to a Mixer.  Methods common to all classes:
//
// ContextMap cm(M, C); creates using about M bytes of memory (a power
//   of 2) for C contexts.
// cm.set(cx);  sets the next context to cx, called up to C times
//   cx is an arbitrary 32 bit value that identifies the context.
//   It should be called before predicting the first bit of each byte.
// cm.mix(m) updates Mixer m with the next prediction.  Returns 1
//   if context cx is found, else 0.  Then it extends all the contexts with
//   global bit y.  It should be called for every bit:
//
//     if (bpos==0)
//       for (int i=0; i<C; ++i) cm.set(cxt[i]);
//     cm.mix(m);
//
// The different types are as follows:
//
// - RunContextMap.  The bit history is a count of 0-255 consecutive
//     zeros or ones.  Uses 4 bytes per whole byte context.  C=1.
//     The context should be a hash.
// - SmallStationaryContextMap.  0 <= cx < M/512.
//     The state is a 16-bit probability that is adjusted after each
//     prediction.  C=1.
// - ContextMap.  For large contexts, C >= 1.  Context need not be hashed.

// Context map for large contexts.  Most modeling uses this type of context
// map.  It includes a built in RunContextMap to predict the last byte seen
// in the same context, and also bit-level contexts that map to a bit
// history state.
//
// Bit histories are stored in a hash table.  The table is organized into
// 64-byte buckets alinged on cache page boundaries.  Each bucket contains
// a hash chain of 7 elements, plus a 2 element queue (packed into 1 byte)
// of the last 2 elements accessed for LRU replacement.  Each element has
// a 2 byte checksum for detecting collisions, and an array of 7 bit history
// states indexed by the last 0 to 2 bits of context.  The buckets are indexed
// by a context ending after 0, 2, or 5 bits of the current byte.  Thus, each
// byte modeled results in 3 main memory accesses per context, with all other
// accesses to cache.
//
// On bits 0, 2 and 5, the context is updated and a new bucket is selected.
// The most recently accessed element is tried first, by comparing the
// 16 bit checksum, then the 7 elements are searched linearly.  If no match
// is found, then the element with the lowest priority among the 5 elements
// not in the LRU queue is replaced.  After a replacement, the queue is
// emptied (so that consecutive misses favor a LFU replacement policy).
// In all cases, the found/replaced element is put in the front of the queue.
//
// The priority is the state number of the first element (the one with 0
// additional bits of context).  The states are sorted by increasing n0+n1
// (number of bits seen), implementing a LFU replacement policy.
//
// When the context ends on a byte boundary (bit 0), only 3 of the 7 bit
// history states are used.  The remaining 4 bytes implement a run model
// as follows: <count:7,d:1> <b1> <unused> <unused> where <b1> is the last byte
// seen, possibly repeated.  <count:7,d:1> is a 7 bit count and a 1 bit
// flag (represented by count * 2 + d).  If d=0 then <count> = 1..127 is the
// number of repeats of <b1> and no other bytes have been seen.  If d is 1 then
// other byte values have been seen in this context prior to the last <count>
// copies of <b1>.
//
// As an optimization, the last two hash elements of each byte (representing
// contexts with 2-7 bits) are not updated until a context is seen for
// a second time.  This is indicated by <count,d> = <1,0> (2).  After update,
// <count,d> is updated to <2,0> or <1,1> (4 or 3).

/*
Context map for large contexts (32bits).
Maps to a bit history state, a 3 MRU byte history, and 1 byte RunStats.

Bit and byte histories are stored in a hash table with 64 byte buckets.
The buckets are indexed by a context ending after 0, 2 or 5 bits of the
current byte. Thus, each byte modeled results in 3 main memory accesses
per context, with all other accesses to cache.

On a byte boundary (bit 0), only 3 of the 7 bit history states are used.
Of the remaining 4 bytes, 3 are then used to store the last bytes seen
in this context, 7 bits to store the length of consecutive occurrences of
the previously seen byte, and 1 bit to signal if more than 1 byte as been
seen in this context. The byte history is then combined with the bit history
states to provide additional states that are then mapped to predictions.

    /*
    Consider record structures that include fixed-length strings.
    These usually contain the text followed by either spaces or 0's,
    depending on whether they're to be trimmed or they're null-terminated.
    That means we can guess the length of the string field by looking
    for small repetitions of one of these padding bytes followed by a
    different byte. By storing the last position where this transition
    ocurred, and what was the padding byte, we are able to model these
    runs of padding bytes.
    Special care is taken to skip record structures of less than 9 bytes,
    since those may be little-endian 64 bit integers. If they contain
    relatively low values (<2^40), we may consistently get runs of 3 or
    even more 0's at the end of each record, and so we could assume that
    to be the general case. But with integers, we can't be reasonably sure
    that a number won't have 3 or more 0's just before a final non-zero MSB.
    And with such simple structures, there's probably no need to be fancy
    anyway

// This class solves two problems of the DMC model
// 1) The DMC model is a memory hungry algorighm. In theory it works best when it can clone
//    nodes forever. But memory is a limited resource. When the state graph is full you can't
//    clone nodes anymore. You can either i) reset the model (the state graph) and start over
//    or ii) you can keep updating the counts forever in the already fixed state graph. Both
//    choices are troublesome: i) resetting the model degrades the predictive power significantly
//    until the graph becomes large enough again and ii) a fixed structure can't adapt anymore.
//    To solve this issue:
//    Two models with the same parameters work in tandem. Always both models are updated but
//    only one model (the larger, mature one) is active (predicts) at any time. When one model
//    needs resetting the other one feeds the mixer with predictions until the first one
//    becomes mature (nearly full) again.
//    Disadvantages: with the same memory reuirements we have just half of the number of nodes
//    in each model. Also keeping two models updated at all times requires 2x as much
//    calculations as updating one model only.
//    Advantage: stable and better compression - even with reduced number of nodes.
// 2) The DMC model is sensitive to the cloning threshold parameter. Some files prefer
//    a smaller threshold other files prefer a larger threshold.
//    The difference in terms of compression is significant.
//    To solve this issue:
//    Three models with different thresholds are used and their predictions are emitted to 
//    the mixer. This way the model with the better threshold will be favored naturally.
//    Disadvantage: same as in 1) just the available number of nodes is 1/3 of the 
//    one-model case.
//    Advantage: same as in 1).

// Encoder(DECOMPRESS, f) creates encoder for decompression from archive f,
//   which must be open past any header for reading in binary mode.
// code(i) in COMPRESS mode compresses bit i (0 or 1) to file f.
// code() in DECOMPRESS mode returns the next decompressed bit from file f.
//   Global y is set to the last bit coded or decoded by code().
// compress(c) in COMPRESS mode compresses one byte.
// decompress() in DECOMPRESS mode decompresses and returns one byte.
// flush() should be called exactly once after compression is done and
//   before closing f.  It does nothing in DECOMPRESS mode.
// size() returns current length of archive
// setFile(f) sets alternate source to FILE* f for decompress() in COMPRESS
//   mode (for testing transforms).
// If level (global) is 0, then data is stored without arithmetic coding.
